<p>Emoticons were first invented in 1982 by professor Scott Fahlman of Carnegie Mellon University. He wanted to created what he dubbed a “joke marker” and implemented the key combination of  a colon for eyes, dash for nose and closing parenthesis for mouth viewed sideways to form :) (the first iteration of a smiley)
