      <p>President Bush signed the FISA 
      Amendment Act into law in 2008. 
      Since then the government has gone
      through great lengths to monitor 
      activity.</p>

    <div class="from-me" id="bubble-3">
      <p>The FISA Amendment Act 
      expanded the governments authority 
      to monitor Americans electronic communications including roving 
      wire taps, searches of business 
      records, and conducting surveillance 
      of lone wolves or individuals 
      suspected of terrorist-related 
      activities not linked to terrorist 
      groups. All communication international
      or domestic are vulnerable to spying.</p>

  <div class="clear"></div>
    <div class="from-them" id="bubble-4">
      <p>An unknown quantity of purely domestic communications have been captured and read under the FISA Act. Between international borders, the rules of privacy don't apply. Our telephone lines, computer activity, and 
      search histories are all subject to search.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
    <div class="from-me" id= "bubble-5">
      <p>Barring the right to privacy, the FISA Act permits the government to conduct surveillance without probable cause or individualized suspicion. How do we exist under the premise that we are always watched? Especially if the government must spy on us without particular warrants or meaningful review from impartial judges. </p>

    <div class="from-them" id="bubble-6">
 <p>If the government can't serve and protect
 our data, how can we arm ourselves? By resigning
 the majority of our communication to online
 platforms and social media, users are vulnerable
 to surveillance and digital capitalism.

      <p> Most users have their most sensitive information and their identities existing  online. Encryption, and protection of these assets are essential to maintaining our well being from government exploitation.</p>
